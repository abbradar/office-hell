//   - `generation` is bumped by `callIter` on each advance. Wakeup
//     reasons capture this at registration; on fire, mismatch = "the
//     script moved on" → silent drop.
//   - `generation` is set to `null` by `drop` to permanently disable a
//     script (entity released, replaced via `runScript`, or cancelled
//     as the loser of a race). Null never matches a snapshotted number,
//     so any in-flight wakeup silently expires. That's the universal
//     cancellation channel.
//   - `raceParent` / `raceParentGeneration` are present iff this
//     script is one racer in a `{ race }` set. On natural completion
//     the done-handler cancels the surviving siblings and calls back
//     into `callIter(parent)`; the snapshot guards against the parent
//     having moved on already.
//   - `raceChildren` is present iff this script is parked on a
//     `{ race }` yield. Holds every spawned racer; `drop` walks it to
//     tear down the whole set when the parent is cancelled. The
//     winning child clears it (and cancels its siblings) before
//     waking the parent, so subsequent advances of the parent see no
//     leftover racers to drop.
//   - `waitedBy` / `waitedByGeneration` and `waitingLeft` /
//     `waitingChildren` mirror the same pattern for the `{ all }`
//     join — see field comments below.
